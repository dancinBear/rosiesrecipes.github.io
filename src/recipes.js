        intro: ["Back when I was a kid, my great grandmother would make this incredible mac &amp; cheese. It was so good that I would swear it was the best mac in the world.", "Looking back, I still think that it's the best mac in the world, and on top of that, the recipe is super flexible! Here's what you'll need:"],
        ingredients: ["1 pound of pasta - any kind works, but for best results I suggest either penne or macaroni.", "1 pound of shredded cheese - I recommend sharp cheddar, but this is entirely up to your taste.", "1 stick of butter", "1 cup of milk", "4 eggs"],
        procedure: ["First, cook the pasta. You want it to be fairly al dente since it's going to be cooked more later, and for many varieties of pasta this means no more than five minutes of cook time. Once it's done, set it aside in a colander to drain and cool.", "While the pasta is cooling, take the eggs and crack them into a medium-sized bowl. Beat them together with a fork, and mix in the milk.", "Next, chop up the stick of butter into small chunks, and add them into the egg/milk mixture. It will be chunky and might clump together a bit, but don't worry!", "Once your pasta is cool enough that it won't cook the eggs on contact, move it into a large mixing bowl and pour the egg/milk/butter mixture in. Mix it around until the chunks of butter seem to be evenly distributed, at which point you should add about half of the shredded cheese.", "After you finish mixing the cheese in, grease a 9x13 casserole pan with butter, and pour the pasta into it. Spread it out so that the surface is fairly flat, and then put the rest of the cheese on top", "Season the top with salt and pepper, and then place in a 350 degree oven for 30-40 minutes. You'll know it's done when the top looks nice and crispy."]

        intro: ["I have never actually had this recipe when my great grandmother made it, but when I found it among her recipes, I knew I had to try it.", "God this sounds insincere. I gotta figure out a better way to write this stuff."],
        ingredients: ["1 stick of butter", "1 cup of sugar", "1 cup of flour", "2 teaspoons of baking powder", "2/3 of a cup of milk", "1 egg", "2 cups of peaches - fresh, frozen, or canned", "4 more tablespoons of sugar, to sprinkle on top", "Cinnamon"],
        procedure: ["Start off by putting the stick of butter into a 9x9 pan. Place that into your oven as you preheat it to 375 degrees, and check it every once in a while until it is thoroughly melted.", "While the butter is melting, put together the batter. Mix the sugar, flour, baking powder, milk, and egg together in a medium-sized bowl until they are fairly smooth.", "Once the butter is done melting, take it out of the oven and pour the batter into it. <em>Do not mix this.</em> Instead, let it sit for a few minutes, until the butter rises up around the batter, fully submerging it.", "Next, add the peaches. Let them sink in until they are fully submerged.", "Once that's done, sprinkle the additional 4 tablespoons of sugar over the top of the mixture with a bit of cinnamon.", "Finally, place the cobbler into the oven, baking it for 45 minutes at 375 degrees."]
